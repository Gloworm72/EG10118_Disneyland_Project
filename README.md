# EG10118_Disneyland_Project
Throughout the spring semester of my first year, I developed an app in MATLAB's App Designer along with one other person (Jack Blake) in my Engineering Computing course.

### Given Instructions for the Project:
Working with a partner, you will develop an app through MATLAB that will be used to analyze a
set of data and obtain meaningful information (i.e., extracting information from the data). The
project will involve selecting a data set(s), processing the data to obtain the desired
information, and creating an interactive visualization of that information that can be controlled
by the user of the app.

### Chosen Data Set:
Our common love for themeparks made us choose a data set developed by Kwan Hui LIM, found at the following link:<p>

**As described on his website:** "This dataset comprises a set of users and their visits to various attractions in five theme parks (Disneyland, Epcot, California Adventure, Disney Hollywood and Magic Kindgom). The user-attraction visits are determined based on geo-tagged Flickr photos that are: (i) posted from Aug 2007 to Aug 2017 and retrieved using the Flickr API; (ii) then mapped to specific attraction location and attraction categories; and (iii) then grouped into individual travel sequences (consecutive user-attraction visits that differ by <8hrs). Other associated datasets are the "List of Attractions/POIs" dataset ("POI-{themeParkName}.csv" files from "poiList-sigir17.zip") and "Attraction/POI Cost-Profit Table" dataset ("costProfCat-{themeParkName}POI-all.csv" files from "costProf-sigir17.zip")."
